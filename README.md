# tlib is a graphics library for turtles.
# It's made to help make game objects, windows and controls.

# Planned future extensions include:
# collision detection, mainloop including the game loop of events,
# conditions to check every second, and a special method for
# adding a score.

# This list will be updated as new extensions
# are planned and current list elements are put into reality.
